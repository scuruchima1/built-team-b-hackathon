# Project Overview

Farmers face significant water-related challenges, such as unpredictable weather, droughts, floods, pests, and diseases. These issues can severely affect crop health, reduce farmers' profits, and threaten food security. Our application helps farmers predict and manage water-related risks by providing real-time, accurate information about soil water content, allowing them to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest management.

# Problem Statement

Farmers need a tool to predict and manage water risks to safeguard their crops and maximize yields. Effective decision-making on irrigation, fertilization, and pest control depends on knowing the water content in the soil. Without timely and accurate data, these decisions become difficult, impacting overall crop health.

# Solution

This web application displays a map of Illinois with county boundaries. Users can select their county, year, and a specific parameter they want to visualize. The tool then generates a plot showing the parameter data for the chosen county and year. Farmers can use this data to optimize irrigation, manage fertilization schedules, and control pests, all while maximizing their profits and improving food security.

# Key Features

Interactive Map: Displays Illinois county boundaries.
User Input: Allows users to select a county, year, and specific parameter for analysis.
Visualization: Generates plots of soil-related parameters, helping farmers make better irrigation and crop management decisions.
